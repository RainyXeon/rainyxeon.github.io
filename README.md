## Howdy my friend ðŸ‘‹
I'm **RainyXeon** (call me **rainy** because I love it), a full stack developer from Vietnam, a small country with technological prospects. 
I started my software development journey in the mid-2020s with the dream of contributing to the open source community.

## Languages and tools that I know
### Programming language
I can do nearly everything, but I do best at `JavaScript (Vanilla / NodeJS)` and `Lua (Luvit / Vanilla)`. 
I'm currently learning `Dart` for `Flutter`, `C`, `C#` and `Kotlin`. 

### Databases
For databases, I mostly know `mongoDB`, `MySQL` and currently learning `PostgreSQL` and `SQlite`. 
But to be honest, my favorite is `PostgreSQL`

### Frameworks
My knowledge about frameworks is wide, but good at `ExpressJS`, `ReactJS`, `NuxtJS` and a bit `NestJS`

And whenever possible, looking to learn more and more things. (Like Pedro)

## Contacts
If you wanna contact me, feel free to send a DM in discord (@rainyxeon) or email: xeondev@xeondex.onmicrossoft.com. I'm willing to chat with you :)

## Some funfact about me:
- Arisu just a code name for DeepinRain production, not affiliated with other character
- I have a history for my official nickname, like: Zero -> XeonDev -> XeonDex -> RainyXeon
- My logo first designed in 2018, so its 6 years old now :0
- My life powered by salmon :) (Ofc with everyone I love)
